<p><q>Writing interactive games and animations is both instructive and fun. Writing such programs is, however,
often challenging. Interactive programs are complex because the user, not the programmer, is in charge of
the program’s execution: the program itself is often a passive receiver of commands, reacting only when some
stimulus in the external world (whether a user’s keystroke or the tick of a clock) occurs.</q> —
<a href="https://world.cs.brown.edu/1/htdw-v1.pdf">How to Design Worlds</a></p>
<p>The textbook intro quoted above is from a companion volume to my favourite introduction to programming, the free online
<a href="https://htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a>. It teaches a Lisp-dialect, Racket, coupled to an application,
DrRacket, which provides <q>everything in a box</q> a beginner needs to get going (ie a text editor, repl,
test framework, ...).</p>
<p>To transfer some of the wonderful knowledge in HTDP to GUI web application development, I selected a video game I originally
encountered many years in Rice University's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1">Interactive Python</a>
Mooc called RiceRocks. This meant the sprites and sounds were all readily available on my PC.</p>
<p>The heart of HTDP is its <a href="https://htdp.org/2020-5-6/Book/part_preface.html#%28part._sec~3asystematic-design%29">6
step recipe</a> which tries to get beginners into the habit of test-first development</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p><q>Testing such programs appears even harder because without the interaction there appears to be no program to speak of,
but automating the testing of interactive programs is especially challenging. Developing clean, well-tested interactive
programs therefore seems especially daunting to beginners.</q> —
<a href="https://world.cs.brown.edu/1/htdw-v1.pdf">How to Design Worlds</a></p>
<p>The hardest part of this project for me has been learning <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, a JavaScript
testing framework I picked somewhat arbritrarily, partly because there's a
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unit-testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine/">Udemy</a> course which I found very
helpful.</p>
<p>Since I did writing tests last instead of first, I'm currently refactoring my code since Jasmine refuses to let functions
it tests see variables which weren't passed to them as arguments, and I used a lot of global variables.</p>
<p>Step 1 is to download the latest <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases">release</a>. Unziping
it produces something like:</p>
<p><code><pre>
./
├── lib/
│   ├── jasmine-3.6.0/jasmine_favicon.png
│   ├── jasmine-3.6.0/jasmine.js
│   ├── jasmine-3.6.0/jasmine-html.js
│   ├── jasmine-3.6.0/jasmine.css
│   └── jasmine-3.6.0/boot.js
├── SpecRunner.html
├── src/
│   ├── Player.js
│   └── Song.js
└── spec/
.   ├── PlayerSpec.js
.   └── SpecHelper.js
</pre></code></p>
<p>Though I probably should have a lib subdirectory (modularising <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/game1.js">game1.js</a>
to separate and abstract the generic parts is on my todo list), I've decided to put all the necessary testing files into
one subdirectory, <code>./test</code>. I don't like the Jasmine convention of using <code>./spec</code> since I feel
<a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">specification</a> and testing are not the same thing.</p>
<p>I've copied all the files in <code>lib/jasmine-3.6.0/</code> to <code>./test</code>, along with <code>SpecRunner.html</code>
which I've renamed <code>index.html</code> to make the report accessible by pointing the browser to the game's URL +
<code>/test</code>.</p>
<p>A thing that tripped me up was following the standard way of declaring canvas</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>const canvas = document.querySelector(&quot;#board&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>resulted in a global constant Jasmine refused to either let functions it was testing see or get replaced. The solution
was to attach all HTML elements I wanted to make global to the <em>window</em> object</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>window.canvas = document.querySelector(&quot;#board&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>which could then be mocked in Jasemin tests with <code>window.canvas = {width: 800, height: 600};</code></p>
<h2>Documenting</h2>
<p><q>Most languages come with a large collection of abstractions. Some are contributions by the language design team;
others are added by programmers who use the language. To enable effective reuse of these abstractions, their creators
must supply the appropriate pieces of documentation — a <em>purpose statement</em>, a <em>signature</em>, and
<em>good examples</em> — and programmers use them to apply abstractions.</q></p>
<p>After testing, the next hardest part fro me has been getting to grips with <a href="https://jsdoc.app/">JSDoc</a>.</p>
<p>I've also tried to follow the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">Google JavaScript Style Guide</a>,
with the exception of ignoring its views of trailing commas since I find leading commas far better.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p><q>Learning coding is like playing cards — you learn the rules, then you play, then you go back and learn the rules again,
then you play again.</q> — From Mozilla's
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web audio concepts and usage</a> guide.</p>
<h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a></h3>
<p>Frontend web development boils down to familiarisation with the bewildering choice of Web APIs available, and
the goal of this first game was to learn a minimal subset to get animation, sound, and user interaction working.</p>
<p>Invariably there are at least four ways of doing anything with JavaScript, and guessing the correct one
involves knowing whether it is old or new, good or bad, functional or object-oriented,
synchronous or asynchronous, block or function scope...</p>
<p>Achieving a desired goal requires an encyclopaedic knowledge of many objects and their properties,
events and their handlers, and methods and their parameters — mercifully <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
MDN</a> is an excellent reference.</p>
<p>These are the ones I've settled on for now. Making the game mobile friendly involved learning yet another Web API,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events">Touch Events</a>, which I decided not
to add the diagram below since it was too crowded already.</p>
<p>I've attempted to draw a hierarchy of the objects I've used, though in JavaScript that's not easy.
For instance, though Document is a child of Window, and CanvasRenderingContext2D of HTMLCanvasElement etc,
coding convention is to treat each as a separate object.
<code>AudioContext</code> is initially addressed as a child of Window since it's the global, root object.</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">Event-driven programming</a></h2>
<p>In the fog of the religious war underway between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">FP</a> vs
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, event-driven programming seems to have been
forgotten. To me, it's the most natural approach for writing any kind of GUI application, including games.</p>
<p>Event-driven programming broadly involves three types of things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Listeners: In JavaScript, these are created with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">
target.addEventListener(type, listener [, options]);</a> where
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget">target</a> is Window, Document, or other HTML element,
and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">type</a> is something like "keyup", "keydown", or "click".
</li>
  <li>Handlers: This is addEventListener's second argument, a <a href="">callback</a> called <em>listener</em> 
     in the documentation.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">listening loop</a> &mdash; the body of a concurrent system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Listeners</h3>
<p>RiceRocks is a game I originally encountered in Rice University's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1">Interactive Python</a> Mooc which I've translated to JavaScript. It makes a good
introductory example because its user input only involves four keys — the spacebar to fire missiles,
the left arrow to rotate counter-clockwise, the right arrow to rotate clockwise, and the up arrow to move in the
direction the spaceship is currently pointed.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, this translates to initially attaching two listeners to the document object which can share a callback
I've named keyListener:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>document.addEventListener(&quot;keydown&quot;, keyListener);
document.addEventListener(&quot;keyup&quot;,   keyListener);
</code></pre>
<p>A big adaption of the original game was making the game <em>mobile friendly</em> by making the screen size <em>responsive</em>
and figuring out touch events, which I'll cover below.</p>
<p>I originally made <em>window</em> rather than <em>document</em> my target, and it doesn't make much difference.
JavaScript events are said to
<a href="https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing">bubble</a> through the DOM, arriving at the Window if nothing
has captured them before then. It's generally good practice to make the target as close to the event as possible.</p>
<p>Rice University's version had a splash screen which was removed by clicking on the canvas with a mouse,
but I left it out since it doesn't add much.</p>
<h4>Where to start?</h4>
<p>Conventional, sequential programs tend to have block called <em>main</em> or a function called <em>init()</em>, <em>start()</em>,
or <em>setup()</em> as the entry point to the programme.</p>
<p>The equivalent with JavaScript web applications is an event attached to the root, window object. As with most things JavaScript,
there's a confusing choice between <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event">load</a> or
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event">DOMContentLoaded</a>, which I've somewhat
arbitrarily picked.</p>
<p>The entry point of my programme introduced me two notorious horrors of Javascript: the
<a href="https://javascript.info/callbacks#pyramid-of-doom">Pyramid of Doom</a> (also known as <q>Callback Hell</q>);
and the <q>White Screen of Death</q>, neither problem I've entirely solved.</p>
<p>I toyed with putting the code below into a function called <em>init()</em>, but decided to simply leave it in the body of
the script because making it a separate function didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> anything. Furthermore, placing initialisation steps in a
block starting with <code>window.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, ...</code> seems more in keeping with
<em>event-driven programming</em> than creating an extraneous function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>window.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, async function (event1) {
  await backgroundImage.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;, function (event2) {
    resize();
    sprites[0] = createSpaceship();
    for (let rock = 1; rock &lt;= 13; rock++) { 
      sprites[rock] = createAsteroid();
    }
    window.addEventListener(&quot;resize&quot;, resize);
    window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>A problem the above code addresses is I want my website to have <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/responsive-design">
responsive design</a> in that the <em>board</em> (ie canvas object) should use all the available screen real estate. To calculate this, the programme needs
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerWidth">window.innerWidth</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight">window.innerHeight</a>, which if used before the window has completed
loading, will be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>The base size (ie scale = 1.0) is provided by the width and height of the background image, which if read before the graphic file has finished downloading
will be <em>undefined</em>.</p>
<p>A pitfall most novices will fall into is that, without care, JavaScript will produce a garbage value for <code>scale</code> using <em>undefined</em>
for its calculation which canvas won't draw, leading to the dreaded <q>White Screen of Death</q> with no error messages or clues on the console.</p>
<p>Before unravelling the above code, lets look at the <em>new way</em>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises">promises</a>, using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> which I've written the function to download sound files with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>function loadSound(url, audioNode) {
  fetch(url)
  .then((response) => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then((buffer) => audioCtx.decodeAudioData(buffer))
  .then((decodedData) => audioNode.buffer = decodedData);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Three asynchronous processes which are contingent on each other — the buffer property of the audio node needs data
decoded by the audio context, which in turn depends on a sound file that has to have finished downloading.
The <code>.then(...)</code> syntax lets us chain these three steps together in <em>sequential</em> steps, hiding the mind-bending concurrency.</p>
<p>The <em>old way</em> of doing this was to nest each subsequent asynchronous step in the callback of its predecessor, which for many contingent steps
would lead to very deeply nested, ugly code — the <q>Pyramid of Death</q>.</p>
<p>Mercifully, the initial <q>window then background image loaded before launchign the loop</q> chain only involves two steps,
so its pyramid of doom isn't very high. Preventing a <q>white screen of death</q>, however, involved the additional step of
invoking JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await">async function (...) {... await ...}</a> combination to avoid the loop getting started before <code>scale</code> was set correctly.</p>
<p>A fourth event, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event">resize</a>, is attached to the window so the user
can make the board bigger or smaller by adjusting the size of their browser, or changing the orientation of their phone.</p>
<h4>How to stop?</h4>
<p>Frameworks which have an <em>init()</em> or <em>setup()</em> starting point tend to have a <em>stop(), terminate(),</em> or
<em>cleanup()</em> function to call at the end. I discovered I needed something like that after testing my site on a mobile phone
and discovering that when I closed a window but didn't shut down the browser, the sound continued. I attempted to fix
this with yet another event handler.</p>
<p>Again, in keeping with my home brewed <em>event-driven programming</em> style, everything goes into a main body code stanza
starting
with <code>window.addEventListener(&quot;unload&quot;,...</code> rather than a function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>window.addEventListener(&quot;unload&quot;, function (event) {
  backgroundSound.stop();
  thrustSound.stop();
  missileSound.stop();
  explosionSound.stop();
});
</code></pre>
<h4>Adapting for mobile part 1</h4>
<p>I naively thought it would be easy to adapt <em>keydown</em> into
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchstart_event">touchstart</a> and <em>keyup</em> into
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/touchend_event">touchend</a>, but it turned out
Javascript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent">Touch Events</a> are a whole new API.</p>
<p>At this stage, expanding the game to handle touch screens simply involves attaching these two events to the <code>canvas</code>
object. I picked <em>canvas</em> rather than <em>document</em> in accordance with
the JavaScript rule of thumb to avoid bubbling as much as possible.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>canvas.addEventListener(&quot;touchstart&quot;, touchListener);
canvas.addEventListener(&quot;touchend&quot;,   touchListener);
</code></pre>
<p>As I'll explain later, writing <em>touchListener</em> proved harder than I initially thought, but nevertheless adding
a new kind of user interaction wasn't particularly complex, and didn't involve any modifications to the <em>guts of the game</em>,
ie the loop, draw, nextTick and other auxiliary functions.</p>
<h3>2. Handlers</h3>
<p>I refreshed my JavaScript knowledge doing this exercise after completing an Erlang course, which has made my JavaScript code fairly Erlangish.</p>
<p>Among JavaScript's <em>newish</em> APIs are
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> which follow
Erlang's approach of creating separate processes which communicate via messages. I'd like to explore this in future, but
for now am not sure how to apply this here where the listening loop doubles as an animation loop (ie doesn't iterate every time it receives a new message, but every 1/60 second to redraw the board). I'm also confused about browser support
for web workers, so will leave learning it for later.</p>
<p>Instead of sending messages, the handlers communicate with the listening loop by mutating shared memory — which works
easily in a single thread (the default for JavaScript web applications at time of writing), but would be complicated if done
in parallel using the multicores of modern hardware.</p>
<p>The guts of Erlang programmes follow a <code>pattern -&gt; action</code> template, which emulating in JavaScript involves its
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch">switch</a> statement.
A gotcha in JavaScript is that its switch statements are <q>Fall Through</q>, meaning that unlike Erlang's case statements
which do one action for the first matching pattern, JavaScript will attempt to match further patterns unless the relevant
<code>case</code> is terminated with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break">
break</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return">return</a>.</p>
<p>I found the choice confusing until I wrote <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#keyListener">keyListener(event)</a>
which has an initial switch block to find if the event type is &quot;keydown&quot; or &quot;keyup&quot;, terminated with <code>break;</code> because
I want to continue to the second switch block to find what key was pressed or released. These cases are terminated with
<code>return;</code> since that's the listeners job done, even though it doesn't return anything.</p>
<p>A JSDoc gotcha that tripped me was to try and tag keyListener as <code>@callback</code> instead of <code>@function</code>, which
resulted in it getting ommited from the documentation.</p>
<p>While I had little difficulty in getting the four user input keys to work, pressing any keys not listened to caused the programme
to freeze until I discovered that, counter-intuitively, the <code>default</code> statement should be
<code>event.preventDefault();</code>.</p>
<p>Another challenge was getting the browser to open a debugging console with F12 — which stopped working after keyboard
events were <em>captured</em> by my own function. The trick here was to write a case statement forwarding this key event
back to the document. To be fancy, I wrote <code>event.target.dispatchEvent(event);</code> rather than
<code>document.dispatchEvent(event);</code> just to test what the event.target property holds.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#resizeListener">resizeListener</a> which
has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent">UIEvent</a> passed to it by
<code>window.addEventListener(&quot;resize&quot;, resizeListener)</code>. But since I also use this as a normal function to initially
set <code>scale</code> after the window has loaded and don't use any UIEvent properties, it doesn't have any paramters.</p>
<h4>Adapting for mobile part 2</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events">Using Touch Events</a> is more
complicated than keyboard events, partly because the event objects returned by
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/touchstart_event">touchstart</a> and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/touchend_event">touchend</a> are not symmetric.</p>
<p>Among their properies are
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchList">Touch Lists</a> containing
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch">Touch Objects</a>.</p>
<p>Of these, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/changedTouches">changedTouches</a> is
common to both <em>touchstart</em> and <em>touchend</em>. Every touch creates its own event, so there doesn't appear to
be a need to go through the list of objects in a given touch event to handle games with several fingers.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#keyListener">keyListener(event)</a> as my template,
I made touching or &quot;untouching&quot; the left side of the screen equivalent to pressing or releasing the left arrow, the right
side equivalent to the right arrow, the top of the screen the up arrow, and the bottom the space bar.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>function touchListener(event) {
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = event.changedTouches[0].clientX - rect.left;
  const y = event.changedTouches[0].clientY - rect.top;
  const h3rd = canvas.width/3;
  const v3rd = canvas.height/3;
  let key = &quot; &quot;;
  if (y &lt; v3rd) {
    key = &quot;ArrowUp&quot;;
  }
  if (x &lt; h3rd) {
    key = &quot;ArrowLeft&quot;;
  }
  if (x > 2 * h3rd) {
    key = &quot;ArrowRight&quot;;
  }
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>Adding touch events proved tougher than I initially thought. But after untangling this part of JavaScript's yarn, I
think it shows how <q>event-driven programming</q> makes it relatively easy to add features to an application, often
without having to do anything except adding listeners and handlers, as in this case.</p>
<h3>3. The main/game/listening loop</h3>
<p>This is a function that calls itself recursively — so it never returns anything since it's an infinite loop. In
Erlang, it would have a parameter called state which it would update and pass back to itself.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the loop is initially called and then repeatedly recursively called via
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">Window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)</a>
to set the rate the canvas is redrawn for animation to 60/second irrespective of the hardware (thereby avoiding a problem
old video games have of running unplayably quickly because processor speeds have increased).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>function loop() {
  ...
  window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
</code></pre>
<h4>State</h4>
<p>In Erlang, the recursive loop would have an argument — usually a compound data structure containing the various
things commonly called a <em>state</em> — which the body of the loop would alter according to messages sent to
it by handlers and then call itself with the new value.</p>
<p>Here, instead of what Erlang calls a <em>mailbox</em> and the C-family would call a <em>message queue</em>, messaging is
done by the handlers mutating global variables which the loop reads each iteration.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/inputStates.html">inputStates</a> is the core messaging mechanism the handlers
use to communicate to the game loop.
All the propertis of inputStates (with the exception of a sound buffer) are booleans, and I've followed Google's style of using a
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#naming-method-names">isFoo</a> convention. For some, I've gotten
into the habit of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake case</a>, so find the JavaScript convention
of camelCase and PascalCase a bit alien, but am getting the hang of it.</p>
<p>Another core state variable is <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#sprites">sprites</a>, a list (or
array as JavaScript calls lists) of <a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/Sprite.html">sprite</a> elements. In
this game, I've made a convention that the spaceship sprite (which somethimes mutates briefly into an explosion
when it collides with an asteroid) can be accessed as <code>sprites[0]</code>.</p>
<h4>List processing</h4>
<p>A really powerful idea from <em>functional programming</em> (FP to its friends) is breaking problems down iterating over
lists, applying the same function to each element depending on which of three categories the task at hand falls into:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter">filter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">reduce</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Map and filter can be built out of reduce, which in pure functional programming languages is usually called <em>foldr</em>
(JavaScript has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/ReduceRight">
for purists).</p>
<p>Since mutation is taboo in FP, the above traditional list processors all produce a new list. If we don't want a new list
(which for traditional functional programming languages would be for printing data from each list element on a screen), we
can use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach">
forEach</a>, which makes all the whizing stuff on the screen with this one line of code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>  sprites.forEach(function (sprite) {draw(sprite); nextTick(sprite);});
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#draw">draw(sprite)</a> obviously belongs in <em>forEach</em>
since it does the GUI equivalent of a print statement, but putting
<a href="http://www.seatavern.co.za/doc/global.html#nextTick">nextTick(sprite)</a> there would be frowned on by
FP purists since the position and other values of each sprite get changed. Since JavaScript encourages mutations
and changing the properties of objects referenced in the array rather than removing and appending new ones is a lot
less work for the programmer and computer, I've gone that route.</p>
<h4>Drawing and updating</h4>
<p>As Mozilla's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_animations">Basic Animations</a>
guide explains, the <code>...</code> above expands into broadly three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the canvas with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/clearRect">ctx.clearRect()</a> and create a fresh background.</li>
<li>Iteratively draw each sprite in these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Save the canvas state with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save">ctx.save();</a></li>
    <li>Move to centre of rotation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/translate">ctx.translate(x, y);</a></li>
    <li>Swivel image <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rotate">ctx.rotate(angle);</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage">
      ctx.drawImage(image, sx, sy, sWidth, sHeight, dx, dy, dWidth, dHeight);</a></li>
    <li>Restore the canvas state with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/restore">ctx.restore();</a></li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Update the position of each sprite before they're drawn again to make them move.</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing nextTick got me to dust off the trigonometry and physics I learned way back in the last century. While my goal
was to keep the game as simple as possible so as to focus on learning JavaScript and its related tools, I couldn't
help making the spaceship recoil a bit when it fires a missile to force the player to use the thruster... I was also
tempted to make the asteroids bounce off each other like billiard balls, but I'll save that for a future version.</p>
<p>In conclusion, writing this game taught me a lot. Besides encountering many of the problems with JavaScript and hopefully
finding ways to overcome them — a neverending quest I suspect.</p>
<p>this document will already make most readers say tl;dr so I'll rather proceed to my next project, creating a dungeon crawler
specifically designed for mobile phones, with only touch user intput.</p></article>
