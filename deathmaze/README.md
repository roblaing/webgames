<h1>Game 2: DeathMaze</h1>

I've decided to make my second game a dungeon crawler, partly because of the wide selection of spritesheets available on the web.

<h2>TDD</h2>

Whereas the focus in <em>Game1: RiceRocks</em> was on learning the basics of JavaScript and JSDoc, here I'm turning my focus
to test-drive development &mdash; a vital concept which should be the first thing programmers are taught to develop the
right habits early

To avoid getting lost in the fog of war that invariably happens when one codes, it's important to first step back
and answer the questions <em>what?</em> your code needs to do, leaving aside <em>how?</em> for later.
 
To get up to speed with JavaScript testing framework <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine">Jasmine</a>, I did this
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unit-testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine/">Udemy</a> course.

Jasmine is niched at a refinemen of TDD, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a>,
which ties in nicely with GUI applications like games.

<h2>Useability</h2>

A Mooc on useability I did years ago gave the good advice of keeping projects looking rough at first, since for many of us
selecting the right graphics and fonts is a slippery slope down an all consuming time sink.

I'm more of a board gamer than a computer gamer, so the name and basic rules of this game from a D&D clone published by
SPI in 1979. 


I took most of the artwork from
<a href="https://musztardasarepska.pl/wgdown/">Warlock's Gauntlet</a>, an open source game I discovered via 
<a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart.org</a>.
